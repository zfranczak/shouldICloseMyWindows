        <strong>Should I Close My Windows</strong> is a web app designed to help
        users make informed decisions about whether to close or open their
        windows based on various factors. By integrating with weather APIs and
        air quality data sources, the app provides real-time information on
        temperature changes, air quality levels, and pollen counts. Users can
        optimize their energy consumption by cooling their homes during cooler
        periods and ensuring a healthy indoor environment by avoiding polluted
        or allergen-filled air. With a user-friendly interface and personalized
        notifications, the app empowers users to create a comfortable and
        energy-efficient living environment.
